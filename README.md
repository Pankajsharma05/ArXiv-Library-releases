## What it does

ArXivLibrary is a desktop research library built around the arXiv workflow —
a fast, arXiv-first way to search, save, and organize papers.

- **arXiv search** — full-text and advanced fielded search, pagination,
  search history, and Cmd+K quick search
- **Library** — save papers into nested, color-coded collections; tags,
  reading status, and markdown notes
- **Daily Feed** — new papers from the arXiv categories you follow
- **Graph view** — force-directed graph connecting related papers
- **Bibliography** — DOI lookup via Crossref, import/export `.bib` and `.ris`
- **Citations & venues** — enriched via Semantic Scholar
- **Custom themes** — full palette engine from base + accent colors
- PDF download and open in your system PDF viewer
