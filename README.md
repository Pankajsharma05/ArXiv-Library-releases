## Overview

ArXivLibrary is a desktop research library built around the arXiv workflow —
a fast, arXiv-first way to search, save, and organize papers, with citation
data and bibliography tools built in.

This is a weekend project built by a researcher to make everyday arXiv work a
little smoother. It's shared freely in the hope that others find it useful.

### Features

- **arXiv search** — full-text and advanced fielded search, pagination, search history, and Cmd+K quick search
- **Library** — save papers into nested, color-coded collections; tags, reading status, and markdown notes
- **Daily Feed** — new papers from the arXiv categories you follow
- **Graph view** — force-directed graph connecting related papers
- **Bibliography** — DOI lookup via Crossref; import/export `.bib` and `.ris`
- **Citations & venues** — enriched via Semantic Scholar
- **Custom themes** — full palette engine from base + accent colors
- **PDF handling** — download and open in your system PDF viewer

## Installation notes

The application is not code-signed, so each operating system shows a
one-time security prompt on first launch. This is expected for
independently distributed software.

**Windows** — Double-click the `.msi` to install. Windows SmartScreen may
show a warning; click **More info → Run anyway**.

**macOS** — Open the `.dmg` and drag ArXivLibrary to Applications. On first
launch, right-click the app and choose **Open**, then confirm. If macOS still
blocks it, run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/ArXivLibrary.app
```

**Linux** — Install the `.deb` with:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ArXivLibrary_v1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

If dependencies are missing, follow up with `sudo apt-get install -f`.

## Acknowledgements

ArXivLibrary is built on top of several free, openly accessible services.
Sincere thanks to the teams and communities behind them:

- **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org)** and its API — open access to preprints and the metadata this app is built around
- **[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org)** — citation counts and venue data
- **[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org)** — DOI lookup and bibliographic metadata

This project would not be possible without their open APIs.
